## Welcome to the machine learning developer's blog

Here I will describe my every day working experience as a developer and share some notes.

### About me

A few years ago, I was introduced to such a wonderful field of activity as machine learning. Now, some time later, I have some journey in this profession, and I am still appalled by how little I have learned in the field of data mining and machine learning algorithms. On the pages of this blog, I want to capture new knowledge and skills.
